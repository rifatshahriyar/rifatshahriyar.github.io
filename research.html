<b>Abstract</b>: 
<span id="c7h" style="display: none"> 
Garbage collectors are exact or conservative. An exact collector
identifies all references precisely and may move referents
and update references, whereas a conservative collector
treats one or more of stack, register, and heap references
as ambiguous. Ambiguous references constrain collectors in
two ways. (1) Since they may be pointers, the collectors must
retain referents. (2) Since they may be values, the collectors
cannot modify them, pinning their referents. <br/><br/>

We explore conservative collectors for managed languages,
with ambiguous stacks and registers. We show that
for Java benchmarks they retain and pin remarkably few
heap objects: <0.01% are falsely retained and 0.03% are
pinned. The larger effect is collector design. Prior conservative
collectors (1) use mark-sweep and unnecessarily forgo
moving all objects, or (2) use mostly copying and pin entire
pages. Compared to generational collection, overheads
are substantial: 12% and 45% respectively. We introduce
high performance conservative Immix and reference counting
(RC). Immix is a mark-region collector with fine linegrain
pinning and opportunistic copying of unambiguous
referents. Deferred RC simply needs an object map to deliver
the first conservative RC. We implement six exact collectors
and their conservative counterparts. Conservative Immix
and RC come within 2 to 3% of their exact counterparts.
In particular, conservative RC Immix is slightly faster than a
well-tuned exact generational collector. These findings show
that for managed languages, conservative collection is compatible
with high performance.

<b>Abstract</b>: 
<span id="c6h" style="display: none"> 
Despite some clear advantages and recent advances, reference
counting remains a poor cousin to high-performance
tracing garbage collectors. The advantages of reference
counting include a) immediacy of reclamation, b) incrementality,
and c) local scope of its operations. After decades
of languishing with hopelessly bad performance, recent
work narrowed the gap between reference counting and the
fastest tracing collectors to within 10%. Though a major advance,
this gap remains a substantial barrier to adoption in
performance-conscious application domains.<br/><br/>

Our work identifies heap organization as the principal
source of the remaining performance gap. We present the
design, implementation, and analysis of a new collector,
RC Immix, that replaces reference counting's traditional
free-list heap organization with the line and block heap
structure introduced by the Immix collector. The key innovations
of RC Immix are 1) to combine traditional reference
counts with per-line live object counts to identify
reusable memory and 2) to eliminate fragmentation by integrating
copying with reference counting of new objects
and with backup tracing cycle collection. In RC Immix, reference
counting offers efficient collection and the line and
block heap organization delivers excellent mutator locality
and efficient allocation. With these advances, RC Immix
closes the 10% performance gap, outperforming a highly
tuned production generational collector. By removing the
performance barrier, this work transforms reference counting
into a serious alternative for meeting high performance
objectives for garbage collected languages.

<b>Abstract</b>: 
<span id="c5h" style="display: none"> 
Reference counting and tracing are the two fundamental approaches that have underpinned garbage collection since 1960. However, despite some compelling advantages, reference counting is almost completely ignored in implementations of high performance systems today. In this paper we take a detailed look at reference counting to understand its behavior and to improve its performance. We identify key design choices for reference counting and analyze how the behavior of a wide range of benchmarks might affect design decisions. As far as we are aware, this is the first such quantitative study of reference counting. We use insights gleaned from this analysis to introduce a number of optimizations that significantly improve the performance of reference counting.<br><br>
We find that an existing modern implementation of reference counting has an average 30% overhead compared to tracing, and that in combination, our optimizations are able to completely eliminate that overhead. This brings the performance of reference counting on par with that of a well tuned mark-sweep collector. We keep our in-depth analysis of reference counting as general as possible so that it may be useful to other garbage collector implementers. Our finding that reference counting can be made directly competitive with well tuned mark-sweep should shake the community's prejudices about reference counting and perhaps open new opportunities for exploiting reference counting's strengths, such as localization and immediacy of reclamation.

<b>Abstract</b>: 


<span id="j3h" style="display: none"> 


Health monitoring is repeatedly mentioned as one of the main application areas for Pervasive computing. Mobile Health Care is the integration of mobile computing and health monitoring. It is the application of mobile computing technologies for improving communication among patients, physicians, and other health care workers. As mobile devices


have become an inseparable part of our life it can integrate health care more seamlessly to our everyday life. It enables the delivery of accurate medical information anytime anywhere by means of mobile devices. Recent technological advances in sensors, low-power integrated circuits, and wireless communications have enabled the design of low-cost, miniature,


lightweight and intelligent bio-sensor nodes. These nodes, capable of sensing, processing, and communicating one or more vital signs, can be seamlessly integrated into wireless personal or body area networks for mobile health monitoring. In this paper we present Intelligent Mobile Health Monitoring System (IMHMS), which can provide medical feedback to the patients through mobile devices based on the biomedical and environmental data collected by deployed sensors. </span>

<b>Abstract</b>: 


<span id="j2h" style="display: none"> 


Due to the extensive availability of wireless internet connectivity and low cost light weight mobile devices, an omnipresent customizable service is not a vision anymore. With enhanced wireless connectivity, the handheld mobile devices (PDA, smart phone, cell phone, etc.) can act as a digital personal secretary, being employed in all aspects of life for the purposes ranging from accessing wide range of information to performing various types of activities with greater ease and comfort. If this type of service can be made a reality, it can be used by different types of users in different fields such as education, tourism, shopping or business, at any time and at any place. Here we present Ubiquitous Secretary, which is designed and developed to accomplish the above objectives. Ubiquitous computing applications developed so far are all independent and rich in their own domains but they suffer from the problem of non-inter operability and non scalability. Ubiquitous Secretary is developed upon the Web Services architecture that easily solves the interoperability and adaptability problem between different ubiquitous computing applications. We developed a prototype and presented how the implementation of the prototype satisfies the characteristics and features of Web Service based architecture.</span>

In modern days, we must use various high-tech machineries and equipments to get our jobs done and make the life easier. These machineries should be controlled by the homeowner from any location as the homeowner might be away from home at workplace or traveling in a different place in the weekend. Thus a system of remote monitoring and controlling are very much necessary. Smart home is one of these types of system equipped with home appliances which we wish to control smartly from anywhere. Some products are commercially available which allow remote home appliance controlling through internet which is undoubtedly emerging. But it lacks the true sense of real mobility and security, making the remote home appliance controlling a limited term than it is supposed to be. In search of a true remote and adequately secure solution to be really effective and practicable, mobile telephony is better than any other solutions.

<p>A Distributed Optimized Resource Reservation Scheme for Grid Computing<br>


<b>Abstract</b> : 


<span id="msh" style="display: none"> 


The idea of grid computing originated in the scientific community and was initially motivated by processing power and storage intensive applications. The basic objective of grid computing is to support resource sharing among individuals and institutions within a networked infrastructure. Managing various resources in highly dynamic grid environments is a complex and challenging problem. There are works for resource management in different areas of computer science. Some approach uses algorithms for resource management to apply in grid but fails to provide any generalized solutions for grid environment. Most of the approaches are based on a simple architecture considering computer as the main resource in their system. But the real architecture of grid computing is a complex one by considering various resources of any computer during resource management. In grids sometimes assurance is needed for successful completion of jobs on shared resources. Such guarantees can only be provided by reserving resources in advance. So resource reservation is an integral part of resource management system for grid. Moreover the cost for providing resource as services will play a significant role in near future when resource sharing will be popular and inevitable but so far there is no work regarding cost optimization model for grid computing. In this thesis we provide a future reservation supported and cost optimized novel resource management system for grid environment considering its real complex architecture. We demonstrate our claims by conducting a detailed performance evaluation and comparing with the existing system on real workload traces for grid computing. </span>

<p>Controlling Remote System using Mobile Telephony<br>


<b>Abstract</b> : 


<span id="bsh" style="display: none"> 


In modern days, we have to be in touch with various high-tech machineries and equipments to get our jobs done and make our lives easier. Too often these machineries serve very important purposes and sometimes require continuous monitoring. But it is not always feasible to be physically near to the system. So, to be in touch with this sort of important systems by not being physically close, we need some sort of remote solution. The remote solution should unleash the restrictions due to physical distance yet provides enough reliability even from distance. <br><br>


We came to know about some commercially available products which allow remote systems controlling through internet. Internet is undoubtedly emerging; yet, it lacks the true sense of real mobility and security, making the remote system controlling a limited term than it is supposed to be. <br><br>


In search of true a remote and adequately secure solution to be really effective and practicable, which can be a better choice to mobile telephony? Mobile phones have become almost an inseparable part of civil lives today. We are all familiar with the CALL and SMS services of mobile phones and use it extensively in our daily lives. Also enhanced data rate services like GPRS and EDGE are common in today's world and it brings the internet to the mobile phones. Keeping the mobile telephony in mind, we tried to analyze the existing services and solutions to the problem of true remote system controlling and came up with some innovative ideas to utilize the power of mobile telephony. We researched and implemented the mechanism so that the ordinary services of the mobile phones can be leveraged to communicate with and control the remote systems. </span>
