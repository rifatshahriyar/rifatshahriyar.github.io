	       \resitem {Designed and implemented several optimizations for reference counting.  Reference counting is almost completely ignored in implementations of high performance systems today. We find that an existing modern implementation of reference counting has average 30\% overhead compared to tracing. Our optimizations completely eliminate that overhead and brings the performance of reference counting on par with that of a well-tuned mark-sweep collector. ({\bf ISMM 2012})}


		\resitem {Designed and implemented our improved reference counting in Immix heap organization. Reference counting generally use free list for allocation. Immix is a mark-region based garbage collector that uses bump pointer for allocation, tracing for identification and sweep-to-region for reclamation. The proposed RC Immix collector will use bump pointer for allocation, reference counting for identification, sweep-to-region for reclamation, and performs defragmentation both proactively and reactively. It outperforms the production garbage collector of Jikes RVM. ({\bf OOPSLA 2013})}
		
                \resitem {Designed and implemented a conservative garbage collector for managed languages based on RC Immix. The existing conservative garbage collectors like Boehm-Demers-Weiser (BDW) and Mostly Copying (MCC) suffer significant performance overhead compared to exact generational tracing collectors. Our conservative RC Immix collector uses a low overhead object map to validate ambiguous references and pin their referents with Immix line granularity. It matches the performance of the production garbage collector of Jikes RVM. ({\bf OOPSLA 2014})}
